### Project Title
Route Planning Algorithm

### Description
In this project, a route-planning algorithm like the one used in Google Maps to calculate the shortest path between two points on a map was built.

### Algorithm
In order to reach the destination at the minimum cost A* algorithm is implemented.

### Time & space complexity
- Timesort has been Python's standard sorting algorithm
- Worst-case performance: O(n log n)}
- Best-case performance: O(n)
- Average performance: O(n log n)
- Worst-case space complexity: O(n)

### Software used:
 **The following software are used in order to complete this project:**
- [Jupyter notebook Python 3, NumPy, and pandas installed using Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)
-	[A text editor, Atom.](https://atom.io/)
-	[A terminal application](https://git-scm.com/)
